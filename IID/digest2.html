<p>Welcome to the first edition of Impact Iran’s Digest - a brief monthly roundup of our coalition’s individual and collective activities and endeavors, all centered around the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we look back to 2023 with the new year underway, it is evident that last year was a challenging time for human rights in Iran. The increase in the number of executions, along with the continued systematic violation of many fundamental human rights, including the right to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, fair trial, and the ongoing discrimination against women, ethnic, religious, and sexual minorities, reminded us once again that the path of struggle for the improvement of human rights is a long and challenging journey, best confronted by strength in numbers and collective endeavor.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This month saw the tragic executions of 4 Kurdish political prisoners, Mohsen Mazloum, Pejman Fatehi, Vafa Azarbar, and Hajir Faramarzi, who had been detained since June 2022. Read our joint appeal against these executions <a href="https://impactiran.org/2024/01/12/uaskppdp/">here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“Impact Iran reaffirms that international condemnation of cases of individuals facing execution, when coupled with proactive diplomatic engagement and concrete actions to hold Iran accountable on the international stage, are not just mere symbolic acts. They are powerful tools in preventing executions and have saved lives in Iran.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later in January came the announcement that Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Nada Al-Nashif will visit the Islamic Republic of Iran from February 2-5. Our coalition members joined a group of 25+ organizations in urging the Deputy High Commissioner to reconsider the timing of her visit in the wake of the recent executions, and the upcoming crucial March session of the Human Rights Council for human rights in Iran. Find the statement <a href="https://iranhrdc.org/open-letter-to-un-high-commissioner-for-human-rights-volker-turk-and-to-un-deputy-high-commissioner-for-human-rights-nada-al-nashif/">here</a> (via IHRDC).</p>

<p>Executive Director Raphaël Chenuil-Hazan pays tribute to the recently executed Iranian protestor Mohammad Ghobadloo at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (via <a href="https://x.com/AssoECPM/status/1750558583530393775?s=20">Twitter</a>).</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>‘The international community is shockingly silent on these grave human rights violations in Iran. The space for protest and free expression is nearly non-existent. We worry that Ghobadlu’s case, without a pretense of any due process, with less than 23 hours of warning of the execution, is another horrific new chapter in the Islamic Republic’s crimes. We urge the Iranian authorities to change course, uphold the principles of justice and human rights, and to cease the use of the death penalty as a tool of political repression. The international community must not remain silent in the face of such blatant disregard for fundamental human rights.’</em></p>
